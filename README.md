# Animalia

The first image <IMAGE 1> attached presents us with a simple classification problem a University has. They want to adopt a newer programming language in classifying the kingdom Animalia into subclasses.
 
The second image <IMAGE 2> attached shows a simple guideline or outline on how they want the classification done; the kingdom Animalia was classified into six different classes taking the presence or absence of some attributes into consideration and as an extra basis for classification.

These attributes are whether an animal
• Has a backbone.
• Is cold blooded.
• Is warm blooded.
• Has a certain body feature for movement.


CLASSIFICATIONS & ATTRIBUTES

1. The Butterfly is class Arthropoda - it is cold blooded, has no backbone and has scaly wings for flight.

2. Fish is class Fish - it is cold blooded, has a backbone and has fins for steering and propelling in water. 

3. Frog is class Amphibia - it is cold blooded, has a backbone and has fore and hind limbs for hopping and swimming.

4. Tortoise is class Reptile - it is cold blooded, has a backbone and has four legs for crawling.

5. Bird is class Aves - it is warm blooded, has a backbone and has feathery wings for flight.

6. Cat is class Mammal - it is warm blooded, has a backbone and has four legs for walking.


These classes are to be coded using the four principles of Javascript as pointed out in the third image <IMAGE 3>. These four principles are:

• Encapsulation
• Abstraction
• Inheritance
• Polymorphism.

NB: Please look at attached images for reference and read my comments on code lines to see why and where each principle was applied.
